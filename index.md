Hi I'm a PhD student and NSF CSGrad4US fellow at UT Austin, working with Professor Jon Tamir in the Computational Sensing and Imaging Lab. Previously I worked in industry on radar R+D, including field projects with NASA to develop low-cost geophysical imaging platforms. My research interests include optimization models and signal reconstruction for accelerated MRI. An ongoing project examines the impact of sampling patterns used in public MRI datasets on downstream analysis and algorithm training. I hope to bridge ideas from applied math, computer science, and engineering to improve clinical outcomes and make medical imaging more accessible.
